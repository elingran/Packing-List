# Packing-List-DD1318-Final-Assignment

The final assignment in the course DD1318, which was the first programming course in the Media Technology program. I was assigned to do a packing list with the following criteria:

Declaration: File handling, data structures, sorting.
During travels, hikes, and other occasions where one needs to remember a higher amount of items than the brain can remember, it can be handy to have a program to help out with that. 

When running the program, the user should be able to create new packing lists and keep track of which things will be brought for which trip by adding reminders to that list.  

The user should be able to:
Remove things from a list
Show all items in a list by searching for the whole (or parts) of the list name

If several lists fit the query, the user will in a menu choose one of them to be presented. 

To know which current packing lists are available, the program must allow printing all list names and dates, sorted by date.

The user enters a date and, all packing lists that have a date equal to or after this will print out.

If you leave the date, all lists in the system are blank.

When the program ends, all information must be written to a text file that is loaded when the program starts.



Extra assignment, grade C: Before error handling in the program, which checks that files you entered exist and that the formats of input strings are correct. Also, make sure that the date (choose yourself in which form and show this clearly to the user) is entered correctly, and that the date exists. If errors are found in the text file, the program should inform the user that errors exist, on which line the error is, and skip that whole packing list and continue.

Extra assignment, grade B: Expand the functionality so that you can now mark objects packed. Allow the user to see either all items in a specific packing list or only those items that have not been ticked off and packed with Ìˆannu. All objects must be presented in alphabetical order! When searching for lists, the date must also be taken into account. If several packing lists apply on the same day, shall be selected and presented in the same manner as before.

Extra assignment, grade A: Add a graphical user interface.
